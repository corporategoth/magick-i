User access levels

These are now settable with the /msg ChanServ LEVEL
command.  Please ask your channel founder what access
levels are required for certain commands.

Any user above the 'Allowed ACCESS changing' threshold
is able to add another user with an access level below
themselves.  So, for example, a level 10 user can add
level 5 users, and either a level 10 or a level 5 user
can add negative-level users.
Founders can add users at any level they want.

Access levels are capped at -1 and 30.  This means you
can only add users with access levels BETWEEN this range.
