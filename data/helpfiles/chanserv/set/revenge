Syntax: SET channel REVENGE {CURRENT|level}

Shows or toggles the current REVENGE setting.  Revenge is
a way for ChanServ to act like alot of scripts that are
out these days - bitchy.  The revenge will take action on
someone who deops, kicks or bans someone of higher level
than themselves (for ban, equal to aswell).  When CURRENT
is specified, the current revenge level is displayed.

Levels are:
  NONE    - Will disable all revenge.
  REVERSE - Will reverse what has been done.
  DEOP    - Will deop (mode -o) offender.
  KICK    - Will kick offender.
  NICKBAN - Will nick ban (user!*@*) offender.
  MASKBAN - Will mask ban (*!*user@*.host) offender.
  HOSTBAN - Will host ban (*!*@host) offender.
  MIRROR  - Will do whatever offender did back to them.
