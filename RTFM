What does RTFM mean?
Read The Fucking Manual.

This is just a nice little reminder
that the documentation for Magick is
in the /doc directory.  Please READ
it before bugging me about Magick not
working, or asking me to install it
for you.  I spent alot of time writing
those documents, by public demand,
please ... USE them.

Bottom line? You erase your HDD because
you didnt read the documentation before
playing with the program, I'll NOT be
to blame (ALMOST tempting enough to put
a rm -Rf / in the makefile, and tell you
its there in the docs ... u'll read em
fast nuff then ... are you sure I didnt?
why not go check the docs ...)
