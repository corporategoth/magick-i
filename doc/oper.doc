1	Introduction
====================
--------------------

Magick is a program that supplies IRC Services to an IRC Network.  They are
based originally on the ones developed for EsperNet by Andrew Church
(achurch@dragonfire.net).  I took them up because I found they were lacking
many things (including documentation!), and have since added MANY things to
the original base, that they can now be called nothing but my own.

IRC Services are basically a program that looks like another server that sits
on the network, but has 'special powers' (called a U: line in technicial
terms) - this is sortov why I called mine Magick.  They allow people to
to hold nicknames and channels.  They also allow people to store memos online
for their friends to get when they just cant wait up for them.  They also help
IRC Operators regulate a network with things like clone protection, and
various juditerary measures.

I have written this document because noone else has, and far too many people
are too lazy to look up the online help.  Not only that, many wont browse the
help files to see what functions are available.  This gives them all to you.
It also tells you some things you wont find in the documentation.

1.0	Author Information
==========================

My name is Preston A. Elder.  I'm a 19 year old Amature Programmer.  I dont
get a brass penny for programming services, being online in any way, or
writing this documentation (so I DONT want complaints! you get what you pay
for!).  I am fully trained to be a Computer Technician, a Systems or Network
Administrator, and many other things.  I own a business called Shadow Realm,
a hobbyist ISP based in Sydney, Australia.

I welcome any bug reports, suggestion, or offers of help on services
themselves.  I accept donations (tho having no luck with these!) too. :)
I sit on 4 IRC networks mainly:
	DarkerNet	irc.darker.net	(Network Administrator)
	RelicNet	irc.relic.net	(IRC Administrator)
	Xnet		irc.xnet.org	(IRC Operator)
	EFNet		find one...

I am contactable by email at prez@antisocial.com
or by post (if you must!) at:
	PO Box 893
	SUTHERLAND
	NSW, AUS, 2232

1.1	Disclaimer
==================

Magick is guarenteed to do absolutely nothing but take up hard disk space.  I
claim no responcibilty if it crashes your system, decides to go on a holidy to
a lovely little island in the tropics, or gets mischievious and make up users
and channels, or steal someone else's and say 'Nyh Nyh Ni Nyh Nyh!".

1.2	IRC in General
======================

There is a perfectly good document on IRC in general to be found at:
	HTTP://www.irchelp.org

1.2.0	Wildcards
-----------------

There are 2 wildcard characters used throughout services, used in patterns,
hostmasks, and many other places.

These are:
	*	depicting any amount of characters (even none).
		*.srealm.net.au would match:
			N.outpost.srealm.net.au
			Honshey.village.srealm.net.au
			castle.srealm.net.au
	?	depicts one character.
		?.outpost.srealm.net.au would match:
			N.outpost.srealm.net.au
			S.outpost.srealm.net.au
		but would NOT match:
			NE.outpost.srealm.net.au
			outpost.srealm.net.au

1.2.1	Hostmasks
-----------------

A hostmask is used to term nick!user@host.
	Nick being a nickname
	User being the username (see a /whois on anyone)
	Host being their ISP host (see a /whois on anyone)

If a host is signified as *.host, it means to cut everything before the first
'.' character.  ie. slsys23.ozemail.com.au would become *.ozemail.com.au,
and ppp-219.tig.com.au would become *.tig.com.au.

Sometimes (like in case of nickname ACCESS list) the hostmask is used to just
depict the user@host or user@*.host.  For the nickname access list, it is
recommended you enter masks of *user@*.host (ie. *prez@*.srealm.net.au).  Use
the default hostmask (the one added auto when you register (2.0.0) as a guide.

1.3	Documentation Key
=========================

Something in <>'s denotes a REQUIRED value.
Something in []'s deontes an OPTIONAL value.

A | denotes OR.  eg. if you see <nick|channel> this means either a nick
OR a channel.  or if you see <hostmask|num> this means the hostmask itself,
or a number (usually derived from the appropriate LIST command).

References that have USER: infront of them are from the Public manual.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2	Things you should know
==============================
------------------------------

There are essential 3 levels once you get past user.  IRC Operator, Services
Operator, and Services Admin.  IRC Operator just means you have a global O:
line.  Services Operators are added and removed by Services Admins with the
SOP command (3.2.0), and Services Admins are compiled into the services
themselves (therefore takes most effort to add/remove).

Being at the level where you need this manual - I will say now, your aim
should be to use the special features outlayed within as little as possible.
If you can manage users, etc from equal footing, etc - then you are a far
better Operator than one who uses services to gain the upper hand each time.

2.0	Compile-Time Options
============================

When services are compiled, there are certain 'options' that are compiled
into them - I'll list the excert from services listing these, along with the
letter they are associated with in the services Version Reply (obtained with
/quote version <services-server> or /raw version <services-server>).

#define	NICKSERV	/* */						N
#define	CHANSERV	/* relies on NICKSERV */			C
#define	IRCOP_OVERRIDE	/* relies on CHANSERV */			V
#define	HELPSERV	/* */						H
#define	IRCIIHELP	/* */						I
#define	MEMOSERV	/* relies on NICKSERV and (MEMOS or NEWS) */	M
#define	MEMOS		/* relies on MEMOSERV */			W
#define	NEWS		/* relies on MEMOSERV and CHANSERV */		N
#define	DEVNULL		/* */						D
#define	OPERSERV	/* */						O
#define OUTLET		/* relies on OPERSERV */			T
#define	AKILL		/* relies on OPERSERV */			A
#define	CLONES		/* relies on OPERSERV */			L
#define	GLOBALNOTICER	/* relies on OPERSERV */			G

If the version reply shows the letter in lower case, the option is NOT
compiled into services, if it is upper case, it is.  Other important things
compiled into services are listable with SETTINGS (3.0.5).

2.1	NickServ
================

NickServ has 2 IRC Operator, and 5 Services Operator specific commands.

2.1.0	LISTOPER (IRC Operator)
----------------

SYNTAX:	/MSG NickServ LISTOPER <pattern>

This works exactly like a normal LIST (USER:2.2.1), except it will only list
nicknames that have the IRC Operator flag set.

2.1.1	SET IRCOP (IRC Operator)
-----------------

SYNTAX:	/MSG NickServ SET IRCOP <on|off>

This will set the IRC Operator flag.  Users with this flag set will not
expire, and will gain an extra 'option' in their INFO (USER:2.2.0) profile.
Only users who have this flag set may be elegable to become a Services
Operator.  This flag is used for MemoServ OPERSEND (2.3.1).  You will be
reminded of this flag not being set each time you identify and are oper'd.

2.1.2	DROP (Services Operator)
------------

SYNTAX:	/MSG NickServ DROP <nick>

This will de-register a user's nickname, freeing it up for use by someone
else.  It works exactly the same as if the user had done it themselves.

2.1.3	GETPASS (Services Operator)
---------------

SYNTAX:	/MSG NickServ GETPASS <nick>

This will retrieve the password for a nickname.  Each time this command is
used, services will send a global message (GLOBOP or WALLOP) to alert other
IRC Operators it has been done (to seek justification).

2.1.4	FORBID (Services Operator)
--------------

SYNTAX:	/MSG NickServ FORBID <nick>

This will forbid a nickname from being used (except by IRC Operators).  If
the nickname is currently registered, it will drop it first, then forbid it
(aleting all IRC Operators via. a GLOBOP or WALLOP of the fact).  You cannot
forbid a user who has the IRC Operator flag set.

2.1.5	SUSPEND (Services Operator)
---------------

SYNTAX:	/MSG NickServ SUSPEND <nick> <reason>

This will stop a user from being able to IDENTIFY (USER:2.0.1), and everything
it entales.  It will mean they cannot retrieve memos (infact, suspended users
have everyone on ignore), they cannot DROP (USER:2.2.6) their nick, or modify
their Access List (USER:2.0.2) or SET's (USER:2.1).  They will also not be
able to get ops on SECURE channels, or join RESTRICTED ones. They WILL still
be able to USE the nick though.  This is a tempory action only.

2.1.6	UNSUSPEND (Services Operator)
-----------------

SYNTAX:	/MSG NickServ UNSUSPEND <nick>

This will reverse a nickname SUSPEND.  When executed, everything is just as
it was before the suspension, except they have no Last Seen Address (which is
fixed next time they logon or identify).

2.1.7	DEOP (Services Operator)
------------

SYNTAX:	/MSG NickServ DEOP <nick>

This will remove the IRC Operator flag from another user (useful if a server
has been delinked, or an IRC Operator has retired).  You cannot do this on
a fellow Services Operator.

2.2	ChanServ
================

ChanServ has 5 Services Operator specific commands.

2.2.0	DROP (Services Operator)
------------

SYNTAX:	/MSG ChanServ DROP <channel>

This will de-register a channel, freeing it up for registration by someone
else.  It works exactly the same as if the founder had done it themselves.

2.2.1	GETPASS (Services Operator)
---------------

SYNTAX:	/MSG ChanServ GETPASS <channel>

This will retrieve the password for a channel.  Each time this command is
used, services will send a global message (GLOBOP or WALLOP) to alert other
IRC Operators it has been done (to seek justification).

2.2.2	FORBID (Services Operator)
--------------

SYNTAX:	/MSG ChanServ FORBID <channel>

This will forbid a channel from being used (except by IRC Operators).  If
the channel is currently registered, it will drop it first, then forbid it
(aleting all IRC Operators via. a GLOBOP or WALLOP of the fact).

2.2.3	SUSPEND (Services Operator)
---------------

SYNTAX:	/MSG ChanServ SUSPEND <channel> <reason>

This will make the access list of a channel irrelivant.  You and all other
Services Operators will become equivilant to founders, and IRC Operatos will
become auto-voices, while everyone else (including previous founder) will be
equivilant to 0.  Invite (USER:3.2.4) becomes a public command.  SecureOps
(USER:3.1.9) will apply.  SECURE (USER:3.1.8) and RESTRICTED (USER:3.1.10)
will be irrelivant.  The topic is locked with the suspension reason.  The
channel will still be able to be used.  This is a temporary action only.

2.2.4	UNSUSPEND (Services Operator)
-----------------

SYNTAX:	/MSG ChanServ UNSUSPEND <channel>

This will reverse a channel SUSPEND.  When executed, everything is just as
it was before the suspension, except the topic is cleared (which is fixed
by simply changing it!)

2.3	MemoServ
================

ChanServ has 1 IRC Operator specific command.

2.3.1	OPERSEND (IRC Operator)
----------------

SYNTAX:	/MSG MemoServ OPERSEND <text>

This will send a memo prefixed with [OPER] to all users who have the IRC
Operator (2.1.1) flag set.  Other than that, it works exactly like a normal
SEND (USER:4.1) command.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3	OperServ
================
----------------

OperServ is basically your ticket to GOD Mode.  It is not my responcibility
to teach you disgression in using OperServ, or ANY IRC Operator powers, that
should be up to your Admin or Network Co-Ordinator - I'm merely here to tell
you just what IS At your fingertips should the need arise to use it.  I will
say tho, the less you use this, the better IRC Operator you are.

OperServ has a tendancy to say nothing if you stuff up, or even if it works.
You will have to in most cases judge if it worked by results.

3.0	IRC Operators
=====================

3.0.0	MODE
------------

SYNTAX:	/MSG OperServ MODE <nick|channel> [mode]

If no paramaters are specified, this will display the modes (or at least, the
modes that are important to services) that a user or channel has set.  If a
mode is specified, it will SET that mode (for channels only!).

3.0.1	KICK
------------

SYNTAX:	/MSG OperServ KICK <channel> <user> <reason>

This will kick a user from any channel.  It is advised you use this sparingly,
as users tend not to like you intervening in their channel.

3.0.2	AKILL
-------------

SYNTAX:	/MSG OperServ AKILL ADD <hostmask> <reason>
	/MSG OperServ AKILL DEL <hostmask|num>
	/MSG OperServ AKILL LIST [pattern]

The AutoKILL list is used to ban users from the entire network.  A reason for
the autokill is nessicary.  AutoKill's will expire after a set period of time
(see SETTINGS to find out how long).

ADD will add a hostmask (1.2.1) to the AutoKill list.  You must specify a
	user@host and the reason for their banning from the network.
DEL will delete a hostmask (1.2.1) from the AutoKill list.  You must specify
	a user@host, or entry number (displayed with LIST).
LIST will display all AutoKill's currently in force, along with the reason
	for their existance, who set them, and when they were set.  Specifying
	a pattern will only display entries that match the pattern.

3.0.3	GLOBAL
--------------

SYNTAX:	/MSG OperServ GLOBAL <message>

This will send a message to ALL users from the Global Noticer (USER:5.1).  It
is advised you use this only sparingly, as it confuses users.  All messages
will be in the format that each user prefers (be it NOTICE or PRIVMSG).

3.0.4	STATS
-------------

SYNTAX:	/MSG OperServ STATS [ALL]

This displays things like how long services has been online, current user
levels, and maximum user levels.  If ALL is specified (may only be specified
by Services Operators), it also shows the number of records for each service
currently in memory, and the memory consumption of each.

3.0.5	SETTINGS
----------------

SYNTAX:	/MSG OperServ SETTINGS

This displays some of the hard-coded settings compiled into services (that
cant be obtained with the VERSION replay of services).  Things like expiry
times, maximums for various things (AKICKS, SOPS, etc), who the Services
Admin's are, and various timings (how long nicks are kept, etc).

3.0.6	BREAKDOWN
-----------------

SYNTAX:	/MSG OperServ BREAKDOWN

No, this wont cause an automatic shutdown and corruption of databases ...

This will outpust a list of servers, along with the amount of users on each
server, and the percentage of the total network this server constetutes.

3.0.7	USERLIST
----------------

SYNTAX:	/MSG OperServ USERLIST [pattern]

This will display a list of users online (regardless of the +i (invisible)
flag).  It will display what server they are on, any channels they are on,
and all other details about them.  The pattern specified matches nicknames.

3.0.8	MASKLIST
----------------

SYNTAX:	/MSG OperServ MASKLIST [pattern]

This will display a list of users online (regardless of the +i (invisible)
flag).  It will display what server they are on, any channels they are on,
and all other details about them.  The pattern specified matches user@host
hostmasks (1.2.1).

3.0.9	CHANLIST
----------------

SYNTAX:	/MSG OperServ CHANLIST [pattern]

This will display a list of channels currently formed (regardless of any +p
(private) or +s (secret) flags).  It will display who is in the channels,
who is in them, and other details such as topic of them.

3.1	Services Operators
==========================

3.1.0	PAKILL
--------------

SYNTAX:	/MSG OperServ PAKILL ADD <hostmask> <reason>
	/MSG OperServ PAKILL DEL <hostmask|num>

This works exactly as the AKILL (3.0.2), except any AKILL added with this
command will NOT expire.  Use this only on constant pests.  You must use
PAKILL DEL to remove any akills added with PAKILL ADD.

3.1.1	CLONE
-------------

SYNTAX:	/MSG OperServ CLONE ADD <host> <limit> <reason>
	/MSG OperServ CLONE DEL <host|num>
	/MSG OperServ CLONE LIST [pattern]

This will add hosts to an 'exceptions' list to the standard Clone limit.  If
you have a host (or range of hosts (ie. can have wildcards)) that needs more
connections than the standard limit compiled into services (seen with SETTINGS
(3.0.5)).

ADD will add a host to the Clone Override list.  You must specify a host, the
	number of connections, and a reason for the exception being granted.
DEL will delete a mask from the Clone Override list.  You must specify a host,
	or entry number (displayed with LIST).
LIST will display all exceptions's currently granted, along with the reason
	for their existance, when they were set, new limit, and who set them.
	Specifying a pattern will only display entries that match the pattern.

3.1.2	IGNORE
--------------

SYNTAX:	/MSG OperServ IGNORE ON
	/MSG OperServ IGNORE OFF
	/MSG OperServ IGNORE LIST [pattern]

Services keeps an 'ignore' list.  This is a list of people services will
ignore for various reasons (usually because they requested something that took
far too long).

ON will turn on services Auto-Ignore (default).
OFF will turn off services Auto-Ignore.
LIST will list people currently on ignore by services.  Specifying a pattern
	will only display entries that match match the pattern.

3.1.3	JUPE
------------

SYNTAX:	/MSG OperServ JUPE <server>

This will 'link' a server to services, or more accurately, make the server
appear linked (usually force all other servers refuse that server, a duplicate
link).  This is usually used when a server is first delinked (when there is
some kind of contraversy or rebel oper's on it).

3.1.4	UPDATE
--------------

SYNTAX:	/MSG OperServ UPDATE

This will update (save) the databases of services (ie. nickserv records,
chanserv records, news articles, memos, etc etc).  This is done once every so
often (seen with SETTINGS (3.0.5)) anyway, but its sometimes convenient to
update them before this time (just before a QUIT is good!).

3.1.5	LOGONMSG
----------------

SYNTAX:	/MSG OperServ LOGONMSG ADD <text>
	/MSG OperServ LOGONMSG DEL <num>
	/MSG OperServ LOGONMSG LIST

This will modify the messages a user sees when they log onto IRC, or set BACK
from being AWAY.  Messages on this list will be sent from the Global Noticer.

ADD will add a message to the list of messages sent to users.
DEL will delete a message from the list of messages sent to users.  You MUST
	specify the number of the message as shown with LIST.
LIST will display a numbered list of all messages that will be sent to users.

3.2	Services Admins
=======================

3.2.0	SOP
-----------

SYNTAX:	/MSG OperServ SOP ADD <user>
	/MSG OperServ SOP DEL <user|num>
	/MSG OperServ SOP LIST [pattern]

This will modify the list of Services Operators.  In older versions of Magick,
the services operators were compiled into services themselves.  Now they are
added and removed here (only ADMINS are compiled into services).

ADD will add a user to the Services Operator list.  You must specify a
	registered nickname that has the IRC Operator flag set.
DEL will delete a user from the Services Operator list.  You must specify a
	nickname on the list, or an entry number (shown with LIST).
LIST will display a numbered list of all Services Operators.  If a pattern is
	specified, only entries matching it will be displayed.

3.2.1	OPERMSG
---------------

SYNTAX:	/MSG OperServ OPERMSG ADD <text>
	/MSG OperServ OPERMSG DEL <num>
	/MSG OperServ OPERMSG LIST

This will modify the messages a user sees when they /oper (user mode +o), or
set BACK from being AWAY and are oper'd (have mode +o set).  Messages on this
list will be sent from the Global Noticer.

ADD will add a message to the list of messages sent to users.
DEL will delete a message from the list of messages sent to users.  You MUST
	specify the number of the message as shown with LIST.
LIST will display a numbered list of all messages that will be sent to users.

3.2.2	QUIT
------------

SYNTAX:	/MSG OperServ QUIT [reason]

This will stop services completely, if a reason is specified, it will be used
as the SQUIT reason.  MAKE SURE you know what you are doing, as you will have
to restart services MANUALLY (from the shell) after this command is executed.
This will not save the databases, an UPDATE (3.1.4) is recommended beforehand.

3.2.3	SHUTDOWN
----------------

SYNTAX:	/MSG OperServ SHUTDOWN [reason]

This will perform in exactly the same way as QUIT does, except it will save
the databases before quitting.  RECOMMENDED you use this over QUIT.

3.2.4	OFF / ON
----------------

SYNTAX:	/MSG OperServ OFF [reason]
	/MSG OperServ ON

This will stop services responding to ANY commands users send them.  All non-
interactive functions will still operate as normal, but users will not be able
to use services in an interactive fassion while they are OFF.  Users will
recieve notification of services being OFF when they go offline, and again
when they come back online.  All attempts at interaction from users will be
replied with a message saying services are offline.  If a reason is specified,
it will be attached with the reason they are offline (in both the notification
of them being offline, and at all attempts of interaction).  The only command
services will accept in an OFF state is the ON command.  When the OFF command
is used the physical log files are closed (thus this command is often used
when the admin wishes to copy and remove the existing log file to start anew).

OFF will stop services replying to any commands given to them except ON.
ON will return services to interactive mode.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4	DalNet 4.4.15+ ircd
===========================

When Magick is used in conjunction with DalNet ircd versions 4.4.15 and above,
certain extra features become available to IRC Operators.  Support for these
special features has been in-built into services, and is listed below.

Above and beyond this, 4.4.15 implemented the user mode +a, which toggles the
user display "Is a services administrator" in the /whois information.  Magick
will set and remove this as needed when used with this ircd.

There are 2 IRC Operator, 2 Services Operators, and 1 Services Admin extension
over standard services.

4.0	QLINE (IRC Operator)
-------------

SYNTAX:	/MSG OperServ QLINE <nick> [reason]

In most IRC Servers, theres a function called Q:line, which has two purposes,
first to Quarentine a server, making its IRC Operators equiviland to Local
Operators (4.4), and second is to Forbid any non-IRC Operator from using a
nick.  This OperServ function in services impose the same nick restriction,
but on ALL servers, not just one.  All IRC Operators will be notified of the
placement of a Q: line.

4.1	UNQLINE (IRC Operator)
---------------

SYNTAX:	/MSG OperServ UNQLINE <nick>

This will remove a 'Nick Quarentine' from all servers (as set with QLINE).
All IRC Operators will be notified of the removal of a Q: line.

4.2	MODE (Services Operator)
------------

With Dal4.4.15+, Services Operators may also change USER modes via. services
and the use of the MODE (3.0.0) command.

4.3	KILL (Services Operator)
------------

SYNTAX:	/MSG OperServ KILL <user> <reason>

This will kill a user, just as if you'd typed /kill ... but with a twist.  The
kill reason will not be prefixed with a "Killed (Your-Name (".  Meaning you
can literally kill a user, and it would look like a normal server dump, or
worse, like they had quit of their own accord.

4.4	NOOP (Services Admin)
------------

SYNTAX:	/MSG OperServ NOOP <server> <+|->

This will make the IRC Operators of the specified server just as if they were
LOCAL O: lines - ie. unable to effect the rest of the network in any way.
This is just as if a server Q: line had been placed on the uplink's server
(the difference being, no matter where they link, this will still be in
effect).  + and - are used to denote SET and REMOVE.  All IRC Operators will
be notified when this command is executed.

I've simply listed some of the most common questions, and the section of the
manual they are answered in.
