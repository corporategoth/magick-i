Scheduled for Magick II
=======================

see www.magick.tm for more details ...

* MemoServ READ (not-new) flags
* Deleting marks memos as deleted, and purge cleanes it out (+ undelete).
* Get rid of the reserved fields in dbases.
* Greet messages (like LOGON/OPER msg) for joining channels (set by 25).
* Endian converter for dbases (SPARC/Alpha <--> Intel).
* Add SPLIT Awareness - if user was recognized before, they are on rejoin.
* Repeated clone kills -- auto-AKILL.
* Re-Write the DELETION functions of some routines (AKICK and ACCESS in
  particular) to accept MASK deletion (like AKILL currently does).
* Dbase converter for other services (xnet/newnet/espernet/etc to Magick)
* IRC Operator Suspend (ADMIN only) -- forbid <mask> from /oper.
* Committee Listing:
	- USER SEES TAG/Desc -- but serv see's dynamic alloc number.
	- Adds to SOP dbase (under a different TAG -- change SOP dbase).
	- Add/Del/List registered nicks to committees
	- Is on <committee> (or head of) shows up in info
	- /MSG MEMOSERV COMSEND <committee> <memo>
* Strict OPER define (only nicks reg'd and on 'OPER list' can /oper)
* Admin (like SOP, but able to add/remove from OPER list, shows in INFO)
* Server lag detect -- Made a start, but the PING command dont work!
	Commented functions in (ie. they disable it!):
		operserv.c:	operserv(), do_help(), do_breakdown()
		main.c:		main()
		process.c:	process()
* /MSG NickServ SET HOST <linked-nick> to swap who the host nick is!

Scheduled for whenever
======================

* Tagging dbases with configurable tag/pass so they cant be used without
  it (eg. incase of stolen dbases).  Admin sets tag and backups use same.
* Encrypting the passwords/data with 2-way crypt (so they are not easily
  readable if someone finds a .db file!), key-based (see above)?
* A way to send commands to the services (especially OperServ) from shell
  or telnet session (like eggdrop partyline?)
* A way to transfer datafiles from primaries to secondaries online.
